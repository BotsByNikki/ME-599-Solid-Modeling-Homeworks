Question 1) Inside or Outside 
Write a function that returns "inside" or "outside" or "true" and "false" for whether a candiate point is inside a polygon. 
The polygon may not be simple. The input point can be a simple array of 2 numbers: x and y. 
The input polygon should be an ordered set of points following the counter-clockwise rule. 
Plot your results.

Question 2) Offset Convex Polygon 
Given a convex polygon with 4 to 20 points and a single scalar delta, offset the polygon. 
Here again, the input polygon is an ordered set of points (CCW inside). 
Delta can be positive or negative. You should extend at corners (no miter or rounding). 
Provide functions, example inputs, and plotting of results. Answer the following questions.

Is the resulting shape the same as if you scaled it with a homogeneous transform? 
What happens to the resulting shape if a large negative delta is provided? What does the polygon become?
