#ME 599 Solid Modeling HW2

Stretch the bug! 
This project relates to the classroom material on tranformations, but also gets you a little acquainted with 3D tessellated meshes. 
As such, the assignment may prove a little frustrating as it relates more to IT challenges than theoretical ones.

Read in the tessellated file ("bug.obj").. Display it (ideally as a wireframe). 
Calculate and show the volume and the surface area of the bug. 
Hint: this is simply the sum of the areas of the triangles. 
Determine the tranformation matrix. 
Show the total transformation matrix that would both rotate an object by 45 degrees counterclockwise about the vector [1, 1, 1] and then scale it by a factor of 2. Now apply this to every vertex of the bug. 
Show the result. 
Show the new volume and surface area.
